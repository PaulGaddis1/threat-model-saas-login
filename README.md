# Threat Model & Remediation Project — SaaS Login + User Dashboard
**Author:** Paul Gaddis (UTSA — Information Systems & Technology)  
**Date:** 2025-11-08

This repository contains a concise threat model and prioritized remediation plan for a fictional SaaS application "AcmeApp" (Login + User Dashboard).

**Important:** This is a design/analysis artifact only — no active scanning or attacking was performed. Intended for portfolio and interview discussion.

## Repo contents
- `report/Threat_Model_Report.md` — completed threat model 
- `diagrams/data_flow.png` — simple DFD illustrating the SaaS login/dashboard flow
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use
1. Review `report/Threat_Model_Report.md`. Edit if you want to change attacker likelihood/severity wording.
2. Use `diagrams/data_flow.png` in presentations or GitHub README.
